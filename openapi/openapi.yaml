  description: |-
    API definitions for programmatic access to DriveNets Network Orchestrator (DNOR). The API calls are modelled after, and reflected in the DNOR User Interface.

    When you first sign up with the SSP, a POST API request (/auth/login) is sent with the following payload:

      *{"username":"user@company.com"*,*"password":"mypass"*}, **where** *“user@company.com”* and *“mypass”* are the email address and password you provided during sign up.

      The API call returns a token value. This is the authorization token for your account. This token is sent in the header of all API requests, as follows:
      1. Authorization: Bearer <token-value>
      The REST API enables you to interact with the SP systems to provision services for your organization from your server-side applications.
      2. Some other text

      ## H2 Heading

      This is also an example of an unordered list:
      - Some item
      - Another item

      ### H3 Heading

      #### H4 Heading
